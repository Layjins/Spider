"prompt_travel_guide": 
1. First, Give me a travel guide to Beijing, put the content into the JSON file, and do not tell me how to save the JSON file using Python code. Give a specific name to the item, for example, street food is not acceptable, but Beijing street food is acceptable. 
2. Second, Copy the above travel guide content, and give me new content with the rules: words that are suitable for image description are packaged with <IMAGE> and <IMAGE-Placeholder></IMAGE>, words that are suitable for audio description are packaged with <AUDIO> and <AUDIO-Placeholder></AUDIO>, words that are suitable for video description are packaged with <VIDEO> and <VIDEO-Placeholder></VIDEO>. Do not pack all the words, let some descriptions without packing with the rules.
